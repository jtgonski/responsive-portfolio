        Hello! I am from Raleigh, North Carolina. I love to travel! I have been to several foreign countries like Spain, Chile, and, most recently, China! I like hiking and camping too. I am an artist and draw portraits and make cool dinosaur-themed prints. I recently decided to give up having a car as a commitment to riding my bike more and being more environmentally conscious.

        In school I studied Art and Design and Spanish. After graduation, I traveled to Spain to teach English for a year, where I mastered the Spanish language and learned a lot about English and teaching as well. After returning to the USA, I spent time doing graphic design for the NC Symphony before leaving to spend more time making artwork (and making coffee too). I am excited about my new adventure into learning to code for web development!
