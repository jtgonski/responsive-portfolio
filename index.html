          Iâ€™m passionate about always learning and reaching for new skills. I am always excited about learning another new technology and seeing how that can build upon past knowledge.

          I love it when my ability to contribute responsive webpages contributes to my real-world interests, which include health and fitness, environmental impact, nutrition and whole eating, cycling, hiking, classical music, public transportation, and civic engagement, among others. Regardless of the topic, seeing how my work has a positive impact on my community or in the world is my number one motivating factor.

          With a background in art and design I have a keen eye for details of front-end development of HTML and CSS. However, I enjoy the logic and puzzle like quality of working with Node.js and Express.js, MongoDB and MySQL.

          With extensive travel experience, including living abroad, and proficiency in Spanish, I am sensitive to multicultural perspectives and experiences.

          Hello! I am from Raleigh, North Carolina. I love to travel! I have been to several foreign countries like Spain, Chile, and, most recently, China! I like hiking and camping too. I am an artist and draw portraits and make cool dinosaur-themed prints. I recently decided to give up having a car as a commitment to riding my bike more and being more environmentally conscious.

          In school I studied Art and Design and Spanish. After graduation, I traveled to Spain to teach English for a year, where I mastered the Spanish language and learned a lot about English and teaching as well. After returning to the USA, I spent time doing graphic design for the NC Symphony before leaving to spend more time making artwork (and making coffee too). I am excited about my new adventure into learning to code for web development!
